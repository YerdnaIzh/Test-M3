## How-to
To compile and run this application simply use the provided script `car.sh` (stands for **c**ompile **a**nd **r**un). To make the script executable use `chmod u+x car.sh` (works natively on \*NIX and on the Git-Shell for Windows). You may need to add `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` as a System Varibale with the value: `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` for cyrillic characters.
